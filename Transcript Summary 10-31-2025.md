## Transcript Summary - October 31, 2025

This chat session focused on diagnosing and resolving several issues within the Ministry Masorite v2 application, primarily related to the Bible study tracking features, and improving UI responsiveness.

### Key Issues and Resolutions:

1.  **"Start Study" Button State Not Updating:**
    *   **Problem:** The "Start Study" button was not changing to "View Study" after a study was initiated.
    *   **Resolution:** Refactored `App.jsx` to manage the `peopleForSelectedHouse` state as the single source of truth. The `handleSaveStudy` function was updated to explicitly refresh this state after a study creation, ensuring the UI updates correctly.

2.  **"onViewStudy is not a function" Error:**
    *   **Problem:** Clicking the newly implemented "View Study" button resulted in a `ReferenceError`.
    *   **Resolution:** The `onViewStudy` prop was correctly added to `HouseDetail.jsx` and then passed to `PeopleList.jsx`. A placeholder `handleViewStudy` function was created in `App.jsx` to log the person's data, confirming the prop-drilling was successful.

3.  **"Invalid Date" in Study Detail View:**
    *   **Problem:** The `startDate` displayed in the `StudyDetail` component showed "Invalid Date".
    *   **Resolution:** Renamed `createdAt` to `startDate` and `currentLesson` to `lesson` in `AddStudyModal.jsx` for consistency and correct data retrieval.

4.  **Database Index (`personId`) Not Found & Visits Not Displaying:**
    *   **Problem:** A `NotFoundError` indicated a missing `personId` index on the `visits` object store, preventing study sessions from being fetched and displayed in `StudyDetail`. New visits added were also not appearing.
    *   **Resolution:** After a manual database deletion (to ensure a clean slate), the `DB_VERSION` was incremented to 7, and the `onupgradeneeded` logic in `database.js` was rewritten to robustly create the `personId` index if it doesn't exist.

5.  **"Add Visit" Functionality from Study Detail:**
    *   **Problem:** New visits added via the "+ Add Visit" button on the `StudyDetail` page were not appearing in the list.
    *   **Resolution:** Refactored `handleSaveVisit` in `App.jsx` to correctly associate `personId` and `houseId` with new visits. A new `studyVisitListKey` state was introduced in `App.jsx` and passed to `StudyDetail`, triggering a re-fetch of visits when incremented after a save.

6.  **"Edit Study Details" Functionality:**
    *   **Problem:** The ability to edit study publication and lesson was needed.
    *   **Resolution:** Created a new `EditStudyModal.jsx` component, integrated it into `App.jsx` with state management and handlers, and added an "Edit Study" button to `StudyDetail.jsx`.

7.  **Manual Refresh for People List (Add/Delete Person):**
    *   **Problem:** The `PeopleList` view required a manual refresh after adding or deleting a person.
    *   **Resolution:** Modified `handleSavePerson` and `handleDeletePerson` in `App.jsx` to re-run the logic that updates `peopleForSelectedHouse` and also re-introduced `setPeopleListKey` to ensure the `PeopleList` component is forced to re-render after a person is added or deleted.

### Current Application State:
All identified issues have been resolved. The application now correctly handles: 
*   Starting and viewing Bible studies.
*   Displaying accurate study details.
*   Adding and viewing study sessions (visits) from the study detail page.
*   Editing study details.
*   Adding and deleting people with automatic UI refresh.

### Next Potential Steps:

*   Populating the "Return Visits & Bible Studies" screen with relevant data.
